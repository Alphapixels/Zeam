Welcome to Zeam!
=================

Zeam is a concept PHP engine made to be extensible, ultra-fast, and awesome. Building apps with PHP just got faster, and easier. It also gets ultra-fast support, and updates. Licensed with the MIT license.

For the extremely experimental rebuild, check the ``development`` branch.

Social
===============

We got an IRC! Just go to ``irc.freenode.net`` and join the channel ``#zeam-engine``.

Warning
===============

Things in the ``development`` branch are extremely unstable. Not for production. Please use files from ``master`` branch instead.

Setup
===============

To set it up, just download the source and place it anywhere, preferably the root.
Then, you can develop and extend it. 

Extend
===============

There is a modules system coming soon!  You will be able to create custom modules, and even inherit from builtin modules to add functionality of your own!

Documentation
===============

Documentation will come when enough code has been implemented to come up with a sizable amount of documentation.
