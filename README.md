Welcome to Zeam!
=================

Zeam is a concept PHP engine made to be extensible, ultra-fast, and awesome. Building apps with PHP just got faster, and easier. It also gets ultra-fast support, and updates. Licensed with the MIT license.

For the extremely experimental rebuild, check the ``development`` branch.

Notice
===============
We are working on a new rebuild of Zeam. Please stand by and sorry for the lack of commits!
;)

Social
===============

We got an IRC! Just go to ``irc.freenode.net`` and join the channel ``#zeam-engine``.

Warning
===============

Things in the ``experimental`` branch are extremely unstable. Not for production. Please use files from ``master`` branch instead.

Setup
===============

To set it up, just download the source and place it anywhere, preferably the root.
Then, you can develop and extend it. 

Extend
===============

To not mess up your source, try not to develop there. Instead, just include it into another file, and extend the classes from there. That way your source won't be so messy and it'll be easier to develop. 

A plugin system is coming soon. Some proposed plugins are: plug&play Admin panel, etc.

Documentation
===============

Documentation will come when enough code has been implemented to come up with a sizable amount of documentation.
